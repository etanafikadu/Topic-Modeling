# Topic-Modeling
We were working on Topic modeling for Afaan Oromo Electronic health documents. Since health data is available in unorganized form, All the collected documents lack label information, which presents a significant challenge for categorizing and analyzing the data effectively. Without labels, it becomes difficult to apply traditional supervised learning methods that rely on labeled datasets for training models. However, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) offers a solution to this problem by enabling the discovery of hidden topics within the documents without requiring predefined labels. By analyzing word patterns and distributions across the corpus, LDA can automatically group similar documents together based on their underlying topics, providing a structured way to understand and explore the content even in the absence of explicit labels.
